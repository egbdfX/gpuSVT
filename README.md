# gpuSVT

**gpuSVT** is a GPU accelerated singular value thresholding software written in Python.

## Installation

On Linux, after downloading the software package from https://github.com/egbdfX/gpuSVT, the programme can be built with:
```
conda create --name SVTexample python=3.9
conda activate SVTexample
cd /path/to/code
make
pip install cupy-cuda
pip install scipy
pip install mat4py
```
The main function of the package is in *gpuSVT_main.py*.

## Example

Download the *example* file, which includes three input files (*ini.mat*, *pyinp.mat*, *pymask.mat*) and a script file (*gpuSVT_example.py*).

Please note that the images used in the inputs of the example are generated based on [File:Russell Falls 2.jpg](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Russell_Falls_2.jpg) which is licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/deed.en) license, and [File:Galu Beach shore.jpg](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Galu_Beach_shore.jpg) which is licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 4.0 International](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/deed.en) license. The input incomplete images are generated by greying, cropping and adding in salt-and-pepper noise on the original images.

Run the script by:
```
python gpuSVT_example.py
```
The output files with the names started by *"nnR"* are the complete matrices. The output files with the names started by *"recon_error"* are the reconstruction errors. Multiple complete matrices and their corresponding reconstruction errors will be outputted separately.
